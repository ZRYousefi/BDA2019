The correct answers for a) are roughly the following:

-probability: a measure between 0 and 1 of a likelihood that an event will occur.

-probability mass: a value between 0 and 1 that tells what is a probability of some discrete event.

-probability density: a function that outputs relative probabilities for given regions in the domain of a random variable

-probability mass function: a function that outputs a probability of some discrete event.

-probability density function: same as probability density

-probability distribution: a function that gives probabilities of outcomes of different random variables.

-discrete probability distribution: a probability distribution of discrete values.

-continuous probability distribution: a probability distribution of values that come from a continuous space

-cumulative distribution function: a function that gives the probability that a certain random value will be less or equal than the real valued input

?-likelihood: p(y|theta) as a function of theta, epistemic information obtained from the data through the likelihood, proportional to the probability distribution (not just the probability, because it can be also density) of theta given uniform prior. Sometimes used also to refer to the observation model/statistical model/sampling distribution.s
